# Workflow from scratch: loose agenda

1. Tidal/Environment routing
2. Create a loose "pattern map" sequence with `fmap`
3. Design a Harmor (synth) patch
4. Design some RYTM (drums) sounds
5. Tighten up the sequence & add variation
6. Let it play / record

Fingers crossed there are no stream or CPU issues!
